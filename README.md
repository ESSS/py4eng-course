This was a crash course of Python taught by [ESSS](www.esss.com.br) software developers to the company CFD/FEA engineers,
since they were writing a lot of code to aid their daily activities (using different languages and environments). The
course material presented here is very straightforward, and probably it's not the best Python introduction per se, but
could go along with [other tutorials](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers) to shorten the necessary
time a student need to be able to create usefull engineering/scientific tools using Python.

Chapter 1 - [Python Basics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/py4eng-en/1. Python Basics.ipynb)

Chapter 2 - [Decline Curve Analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/py4eng-oil/2. Decline Curve Analysis.ipynb)

Chapter 3 - [Files and OS](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/py4eng-oil/3. Files and OS.ipynb)

Chapter 3a - [Regular Expressions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/py4eng-en/3c.%20Regular%20Expressions.ipynb)

Chapter 4 - [Building Graphical Applications - the fast and easy way](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/py4eng-en/4.%20Building%20graphical%20applications%20-%20the%20fast%20and%20easy%20way.ipynb)

It's expected this material to be in constant improvement.
