{"name":"Python for Engineers","tagline":"Crash Course","body":"This was a crash course of Python taught by [ESSS](www.esss.com.br) software dev. department to the company CFD/FEA engineers, since they were writing a lot of code (using different languages and environments) to aid their daily activities. The course material presented here is very straightforward, and probably it's not the best Python introduction per se, but could go along with [other tutorials](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers) to shorten the necessary time a student need to be able to create usefull engineering/scientific tools using Python.\r\n\r\nChapter 1 - [Python Basics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/1.%20Python%20Basics.ipynb)\r\n\r\nChapter 2 - [The Scipy Stack](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/2.%20The%20Scipy%20stack.ipynb)\r\n\r\nChapter 3 - [Optimization Problem using ANSYS Mechanical](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/3.%20Optimization%20problem%20using%20ANSYS%20Mechanical.ipynb)\r\n\r\nChapter 3a - [Regular Expressions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/3c.%20Regular%20Expressions.ipynb)\r\n\r\nChapter 4 - [Building Graphical Applications - the fast and easy way](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/esss/py4eng-course/blob/master/notebooks/4.%20Building%20graphical%20applications%20-%20the%20fast%20and%20easy%20way.ipynb)\r\n\r\nYou can check source codes on [GitHub](https://github.com/esss/py4eng-course/tree/master/source/python) or download them using the links on the right.\r\n\r\nIt's expected this material to be in constant improvement.\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/80x15.png\" /></a><br />This work by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.esss.com.br\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">ESSS</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.","google":"UA-49855960-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
